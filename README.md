# diffusion_model_pytorch

Generative models are a class of machine learning models that can generate new data based on training data. 

Diffusion models train by adding noise to images, which the model then learns how to remove. The model then applies this denoising process to random seeds to generate realistic images.

Diffusion models can complete various tasks, including image generation, image denoising, inpainting, outpainting, and bit diffusion.
